    <h3> Hi! I'm Harini Ravichandran </h3>
    <p> I'm a coffee and Java lover, with a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. My achievements include earning a 5-star coder certification at HackerRank and solving over 1000 problems on Leetcode. I mesh with the MERN stack as seamlessly as sugar dissolves in my coffee. My passion for tech ignited when I pursued Computer Science at SRM TRP Engineering College. Right now, I'm diving into the captivating currents of Artificial Intelligence, seeing its transformative power for our technological universe. Aside from coding, books are my faithful companions. They transport me to different worlds, teach me new things, and sometimes, they even sprinkle magic on my toughest coding problems.
